in africa, car windshields get damaged by small stones thrown up from the road. to repair them, local technicians combine two methods, using a small drill to open the main crack point, and a small nail that is gently tapped to widen the base. after that, clear resin is injected and cured under ultraviolet light until it hardens. the excess resin is then neatly trimmed and polished. as a result, the crack marks are almost invisible, and the repair cost is said to be very affordable.
